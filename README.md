# Vector PDF Search using Astra DB and Google AI

This project is a **PDF document retrieval and question-answering system** that leverages **Astra DB** for cloud storage and **Google AI's SentenceTransformer** model for semantic search. Users can input queries, and the system will return the most relevant text chunk from the uploaded PDF documents.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Features**

- Extracts text from PDFs using `PyPDF2`.
- Stores text chunks in **Astra DB**.
- Converts both stored texts and user queries into semantic embeddings using **Google AI's all-MiniLM-L6-v2** model.
- Finds and returns the most relevant text chunk based on **cosine similarity**.

## üîß **Technologies Used**

- **Python**: Core language for development.
- **Astra DB**: Cloud database for storing PDF text chunks.
- **LangChain**: For text splitting and database integration.
- **SentenceTransformer**: Embedding and semantic search using Google AI‚Äôs pre-trained model.
- **PyPDF2**: Extracts text from PDF files.
- **Torch**: Used by SentenceTransformer for embedding and similarity computation.
